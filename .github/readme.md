# How it works
Using a series of distance functions in JavaScript, we can conclude if and where a ray collides with certain objects
# How to use
Log onto [the website](https://porkyproductions.github.io/RayMarching/) and click anywhere on the board. This will place a obstacle in the way of the light. Moving the cursor around will drag the ray of light around, following the cursor. Alternatively, you can use the spinning or 360degree view modes.
